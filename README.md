# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Playground React Native

Welcome to the **Playground React Native** repository! This project was created as a learning environment during my journey through a React Native course. The main goal of this repository is to explore and experiment with React Native features while gaining hands-on experience with the framework.

## Description

This project is a "playground" where I can practice and test key concepts of React Native, such as navigation, interacting with APIs, using native components, integrating third-party libraries, and much more.

The code in this repository reflects the exercises and practical examples from the course, with the intent to provide an active learning context where I can experiment and see immediate results.

## Objectives

- Learn how to build mobile applications using **React Native**.
- Experiment with core React Native features, including:
  - Navigation between screens
  - State management with **React** (Hooks, Context API)
  - Interacting with device features through native components (camera, geolocation, etc.)
  - Using external libraries (e.g., Axios for API calls)
- Create a safe test environment to try out new concepts and solutions without affecting a final application.

## Project Structure

- **App.js**: The main entry point where the app starts. It contains the basic layout and some example functionalities.
- **/components**: Folder containing reusable components used across various screens.
- **/screens**: Folder with the main screens of the app.
- **/assets**: Images and static resources used within the app.
- **/services**: Functions to interact with external APIs or handle complex logic (e.g., REST calls).

## How to Get Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/playground-react-native.git
   ```
