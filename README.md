# Welcome 


## Get started 

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- development build
- Android emulator
- iOS simulator
- Expo Go, a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses file-based routing.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Todo App

Welcome to the **Todo App** repository! This project is a simple yet functional todo application built with TypeScript. It allows users to check off completed todos, remove them, and includes error checks for empty strings or duplicate todos.

## Description

This project is designed to provide a clean and efficient todo list application. It features:

- **Atomic Button Component**: A reusable button component.
- **Three Main Components**: The core components of the app.
- **Modal Component**: For additional functionality.
- **Error Checks**: Ensuring no empty strings or duplicate todos are added.

The project structure is organized to maximize clarity and cleanliness in the code. The logic is separated from the template, and styles are managed independently.

## Project Structure

- **App.tsx**: The main entry point where the app starts.
- **/components**: Folder containing reusable components, including the atomic button.
- **/screens**: Folder with the main screens of the app.
- **/modals**: Folder containing modal components.
- **/styles**: Styles for the app, separated from the logic.
- **/utils**: Utility functions for error checking and other logic.
- **Barrel Import Technique**: Used to export components efficiently.

## How to Get Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   ```
